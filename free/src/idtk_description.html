                <h1>This is a 64 bit version (Your OS and not InDesign installation!)</h1>
                <h2 class="widgetName">Hi! Welcome to IDTK <small>(In-Design Tool-Kit) beta</small></h2>
                <b><a href="http://3dots.fr/ID-ToolKit/" style=" margin: 7px; font-size: larger;">In-Design Tool-kit</a></b> is a new and unique In-Design extension, we have a lot of ideas of new tools and options that will be added in future releases (with your help and support!).
                In this release you can use this plug-in to create <b>unique auto-generated motifs and patters</b> to create a visually and aesthetically appealing document, be a book, a journal or a simple resume! This product is created with artists for creative people who use Creative Suite products (In-Design in particular).
                This extension will not only do the job of a graphic-designer for you but probably even more (not that you won't need designers anymore!) because it creates a unique visual for each single page of your document making it feels like a graphic-designer spent hours of work designing each single page of your document, but all you need to do is a few clicks of a mouse!
                I made this plug-in with love and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did working (HARD!) to create it, please support the future releases buy purchasing the paid version if you found it useful! thx, ;)<br>
                <p>PS: Please feel free to visit <a href="http://3dots.fr/">our website</a> and/or <a href="http://Armand.eu">my personal website</a>! you may also want to have a look at the <a href="http://3dots.fr/ID-ToolKit/">plugin's site</a> or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLolKuEWfip-G82ZplIyGxYtOSgM6gnIv4">this Youtube Channel</a> that will cover informative videos and tutorials about IDTK!</p>

                    <p>2. Double-click on the <code>.zxp</code> file and let the extension-manager install the extension, but:</p>
                    <p>3. <b>IMPORTANT!</b> When/if extension manager asked you if you want to install this extension for <code>Only Me</code> or <code>All Users</code>, please select <code>All Users</code>, otherwise it will be installed in a directory which is not accessible by default to Adobe In-Design scripts panel (This is because of an issue/limitation of the available default addresses/paths in adobe extension packages which we weren't aware of, but in future releases we will try to fund a work-around for it) <small>If you selected <code>Only Me</code> you can always un-install/ remove the extension and re-install it again</small></p>
                    <p>4. After Installation you may need to close and re-open InDesign (if it was open during installation)</p>
                    <p>5. You can also update the extension by selecting it in the extension manager window and checking if an update is available (In that case an update button will appear right beside the <code>Remove</code> button.</p>

                        <div style="background-color: gold; color: #666666; margin: 0px; padding: 33px 66px; text-align: justify; font-family: sans-serif;">
                            <h1>Known Issues:</h1>
                            <p>
                            <ul>1. Ctrl + Tab between documents (if there is more than one document open): You should close and re-open the plugin window, otherwise it may behave in a wierd way! (planned to get fixed in future releases)</ul>
                            <ul>2. Transparent images are gone in Lite versions for some resean! (a patch will be out very soon! sorry!);</ul>
                            <ul>3. Page selection: images are imported in wrong pages! (This is fixed now!)</ul>
                            <ul>4. tooltips aren't disabled sometimes even though the option in settings tab is changed! (will be fixed soon)</ul>
                            <ul>5. Limitiation On file system permissions when the product is installed in the main application script folder -> this is solved now temporarily but by limiting the extension a lot for just 64bit / Windows / CS6 and English language of indesign installations! we will try to fix the issue in next over-haul of the plug-in (probably after beta releases)</ul>
                            <ul>6. It installs but doesn't work on 32 bit systems! it is because of previous issue and a bug in Adobe extension manager, where if the extension is limited to 64bit systems it (extension manager) won't allow it to be installed even on 64bit systems! --> we will solve this issue eventually (The code completly supports 32 bit and even Mac os) but it takes time specially since we don't have access to all types of systems and/or Adobe indesign versions, so we will try to fully support Windows first (and 64bit versions in priority) then if we got enough support to be able to develop it further, we will definitely increase our supporting platforms.</ul>
                            <ul>7. The way to access the extension is not the best way possible, --> that's because it is in beta release, we have plan to make it more user/designer friendly (by adding it to menus, shortcuts and stuff!) but we need to study all the possibilities after we reach an stable version (will be solved probably before first final release)</ul>
                            <ul>8. during the first-time of usage immediately after installation, extension creates images but does not import them in the document --> This issue will be solved in few next releases but right know as an easy work around just run the plug-in again with same settings and it should work fine (This is due to same limitation mentioned in previous items -We know! super annoying!-)</ul>

                            <p><b>All in all, thx for your patient, We promise to address all the issues one by one to make the first official release as clean and user/designer friendly as possible (we just need your support and if we get it we won't disappoint you! you'll see!)</b></p>
