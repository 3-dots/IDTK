	<h2 class="widgetName">Hi! Welcome to IDTK <small>(In-Design Tool-Kit) beta</small></h2>
	<b><a href="http://3dots.fr/ID-ToolKit/" style=" margin: 7px; font-size: larger;">In-Design Tool-kit</a></b> is a new and unique In-Design extension, we have a lot of ideas of new tools and options that will be added in future releases (with your help and support!).
	In this release you can use this plug-in to create <b>unique auto-generated motifs and patters</b> to create a visually and aesthetically appealing document, be a book, a journal or a simple resume! This product is created with artists for creative people who use Creative Suite products (In-Design in particular).
	This extension will not only do the job of a graphic-designer for you but probably even more (not that you won't need designers anymore!) because it creates a unique visual for each single page of your document making it feels like a graphic-designer spent hours of work designing each single page of your document, but all you need to do is a few clicks of a mouse!
	I made this plug-in with love and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did working (HARD!) to create it, please support the future releases buy purchasing the paid version if you found it useful! thx, ;)<br>
