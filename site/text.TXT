What?! (What is this?!)
IDTK (In-Design Tool-Kit) is an extension for Adobe InDesign CS.
As the name suggests, it is intended to be a “Tool-Kit”! But right now it does just one thing! But something really cool! We just released the beta version of one of the tools (modules) of the toolkit which is called “Robot”!
We call it Robot because it is like a Robot! A designer robot! It’s a worker robot who designs graphical elements for your pages!
You just need to tell the module what you want and it will generate customized, beautiful patterns and motifs tailored for your document! But wait! Anybody can do that! (Well c’mon! not anybody! But a good graphic designer can) But it’s not all it can do for you! In fact it works on every single page of your document and makes a unique version of the selected patterns for each and every single page of your document (you can select which pages too), something normal “human” graphic designers just can’t do (or if they do, they will need days and weeks and… even months if you have hundreds of hundreds of pages!), so each page will be different than the others! Because otherwise that’d be boring! Wouldn’t it? Whatever! Just let the Robot help you!
PS: Well! We didn’t talk much about the name since it’s supposed be a kit with lot’s (or a few at least) tools, not a tool-box with just one tool in it! … Yeah! Well! The idea behind the name is that we’re going to build up on it gradually! Adding more tools and features, to make it more like a real tool-kit for page-designers and publishers.
We already have lots of ideas and we are impatient to start working on them but it all depends on how the community receives our work! We worked really hard and built this tool up from the ground with pure love and we need your support to continue doing so!
