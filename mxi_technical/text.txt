Summury:

In-Design Toolkit is a collection of tools to help you design better and make prettier documents for publishing on-line or offset printing. Please refer to http://3dots.fr/ID-ToolKit for more info.


Release notes:
This is the first release and still in beta.
Please let me know if you found any bug or issue!
=====================
Please refer to http://3dots.fr/ID-ToolKit/idtk_description for more info.



Instalation Notes:
1. Download the In-Design Tool-kit extension either from Adobe exchange website or Extension's website.

2. Double-click on the .zxp file and let the extension-manager install the extension, but:

3. IMPORTANT! When/if extension manager asked you if you want to install this extension for Only Me or All Users, please select All Users, otherwise it will be installed in a directory which is not accessible by default to Adobe In-Design scripts panel (This is because of an issue/limitation of the available default addresses/paths in adobe extension packages which we weren't aware of, but in future releases we will try to fund a work-around for it) If you selected Only Me you can always un-install/ remove the extension and re-install it again

4. After Installation you may need to close and re-open InDesign (if it was open during installation)

5. You can also update the extension by selecting it in the extension manager window and checking if an update is available (In that case an update button will appear right beside the Remove button.

+ you need the latest version of Java or it won't work!

-Please refer to http://3dots.fr/ID-ToolKit/idtk_description for more info.



Description:
Please note! This is a 64bit version! also due to Adobe exchange site's file-size limitation it is not possible to embed Java! so you'll need to install latest version of Java if you don't have it already (http://java.com/download)
====================================================================================================
<b>Hi there and Welcome to IDTK </b>( Indesign Toolkit )
    <b>In-Design Tool-kit</b> is a new and unique In-Design extension, we have a lot of ideas of new tools and options that will be added in future releases (with your help and support!).
    In this release you can use this plug-in to create <b>unique auto-generated motifs and patters</b> to create a visually and aesthetically appealing document, be a book, a journal or a simple resume! This product is created with artists for creative people who use Creative Suite products (In-Design in particular).
    This extension will not only do the job of a graphic-designer for you but probably even more (not that you won't need designers anymore!) because it creates a unique visual for each single page of your document making it feels like a graphic-designer spent hours of work designing each single page of your document, but all you need to do is a few clicks of a mouse!
    I made this plug-in with love and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did working (HARD!) to create it, please support the future releases buy purchasing the paid version if you found it useful! thx, ;)<br>
    At end you can watch a video of how it works at <b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLolKuEWfip-G82ZplIyGxYtOSgM6gnIv4">this linke</a></b>
<p>PS2: Always save your document and make a backup of your project before opening a script!</p>

Note to approver:
Hi!
+ last minute update: Due to Adobe exchange zxp file-size limitation (15mb) I couldn't embed Java even in 64-bit version! (it would've been 36 mb), so you need to install latest version Java if you don't have it already! thx (http://java.com/download) (Java embedded version could be found here: https://github.com/3-dots/IDTK/raw/master/free/idtk_free.zxp)
- During the installation when it asks for user-scope Please select "All users" (full explanation here: http://3dots.fr/ID-ToolKit/idtk_description) otherwise it won't be installed in the right directory
- Also in this release, the extension only works in 64 bit versions of Windows OS (it needs Java VM embeddable just in 64-bit systems but I'll add the mechanisms to guide the users how to install Java in case of absent and will release the 32-bit too then) but due to a bug (I guess! is it a known bug?) in Adobe extension manager if I limit the package to 64-bit systems it won't let it to be installed even in 64 bit systems! so I just left it like that for know but I explained in package's descriptions and instructions about this (more explanation here: http://3dots.fr/ID-ToolKit/idtk_description)
- After installation you'll find the Folder "IDTK" under the "user"'s folder in the Scripts panel (alt + ctrl + F11), please double click on the file called "OPEN_ME.jsx" in this folder and the extension UI will open.
- I tested the package on two systems (Windows Vista and 8 64) with ID CS6 and it works very well.
- This is a beta and work in progress yet, but I need my users feedback to continue.

Thx a lot and have a good day :)
