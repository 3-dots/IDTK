#### Publishing technical resources:
====================================


> To publish for Adobe Exchange you can find a few helpful technical resources in this page!
> First of all you can check AdobeExchange.com resources website to get some information:
> - www.adobeexchange.com/resources/1
> - www.adobeexchange.com/resources/2
> - www.adobeexchange.com/resources/ ... !
>
> Then you can download very useful pdf by Adobe [help.adobe.com/en_US/extensionmanager/cs/using/MXI_tech_note.pdf](MXI_tech_note.pdf), to have detailed/ advance knowledge for the matter!
> You may also want to have a look inside the mxi samples folder provided by Adobe (I don't have the link so I put the folder in this repo!)
